# Golang Design Patterns 🚀

Welcome to the **Golang Design Patterns** repository! This project is your ultimate reference guide for mastering design patterns in the Go programming language. Whether you're an experienced developer looking to sharpen your skills or a newcomer eager to learn, this repository provides practical examples and detailed explanations of commonly used design patterns.

## 🌟 What's Inside?

This repository includes Go implementations of various design patterns, categorized under:

1. **Creational Patterns**:  
   Patterns for creating objects in a way that suits the situation.
   - [Factory](https://github.com/Beretta350/golang-design-patterns/tree/main/factory)
   - [Builder](https://github.com/Beretta350/golang-design-patterns/tree/main/builder)
   - [Singleton](https://github.com/Beretta350/golang-design-patterns/tree/main/singleton)
   - ~~Prototype~~

2. **Structural Patterns**:  
   Patterns that help organize classes and objects in a manner that makes complex structures more manageable.
   - [Adapter]()
   - ~~Composite~~
   - ~~Proxy~~
   - ~~Decorator~~

3. **Behavioral Patterns**:  
   Patterns that focus on effective communication between objects.
   - [Observer](https://github.com/Beretta350/golang-design-patterns/tree/main/observer)
   - ~~Strategy~~
   - ~~Command~~
   - ~~Chain of Responsibility~~

## 🧑‍💻 How to Use This Repository

Each pattern has its own directory containing:
- A clear, commented Go implementation.
- A brief explanation of the pattern.
- Examples of how to apply it in real-world scenarios.

### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Beretta350/golang-design-patterns.git
cd golang-design-patterns
```

### Run Examples

To run a specific design pattern example, navigate to the corresponding directory and **run the test file**. These tests demonstrate how the pattern works and highlight the benefits of each implementation.

For example, to see the **Factory Pattern** in action:

```bash
cd factory
go test
```

## 🚀 Why Design Patterns?

Design patterns are proven solutions to recurring problems in software design. By learning and implementing them, you’ll:
- Write **cleaner, more maintainable code**.
- Solve **complex design problems** with ease.
- Improve your **Go code structure** and **scalability**.
